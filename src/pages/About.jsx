            <h2 className='font-bold text-zinc-700 text-2xl mb-2'>Introduction</h2>
            <p className='text-zinc-500 text-xl mb-8'>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Apple designs, manufactures, and markets a range of consumer electronics, software, and services. The company is widely known for its innovative products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, as well as software such as the macOS and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites.</p>
            <h2 className='font-bold text-zinc-700 text-2xl mb-2'>History</h2>
            <p className='text-zinc-500 text-xl mb-8'>Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984.However, Jobs was ousted from the company in 1985 following a power struggle with the company's board of directors. Jobs went on to found NeXT, another computer platform development company specializing in state-of-the-art computers for higher-education and business markets. In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company. The acquisition propelled the renaissance of Appleâ€™s fortunes with the launch of the revolutionary iMac in 1998, and the introduction of other cutting-edge products and services.</p>
